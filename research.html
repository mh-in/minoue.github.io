  <h1>Research</h1>
  <p>
    I am broadly interested in the patterns and processes of genetic diversity and local adaptation across different organisms. 
    My research currently focuses on two main groups: slime moulds (Myxomycetes) and club mosses (genus <em>Diphasiastrum</em>). 
  </p>

  <h2><a href="research-myxomycetes.html">Slime moulds (Myxomycetes)</a></h2>
  <p>
   Myxomycetes (Amoebozoa) are a group of protists, comprising more than 1,000 described species. They are almost cosmopolitan in distribution and often abundant on the upper soil layer, yet their ecological roles remain relatively poorly understood.
　　My research focuses on the phylogeography and genetic diversity of nivicolous myxomycetes—species that form fruiting bodies near snowbanks shortly after the seasonal snow cover (typically lasting over three months) has melted.
　　This ecological guild is particularly suitable for quantitative studies: 
   Seasonal sampling is predictable, and most species belong to the black-spored clade, which can be reliably identified using the nearly universal 18S rDNA barcoding marker.
   Although these organisms cannot yet be cultivated in laboratory, molecular data from field-collected specimens provide valuable insights into the reproductive　strategies of free-dispersing protists and patterns of local adaptation from an evolutionary biology perspective.
